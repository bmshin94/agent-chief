"""The generic outbound pipe (SPEC §4.5, generalized): delivery as a protocol.

Chief doesn't grow a bespoke adapter per notification app — that's the inbound
lesson ("protocol, not pipes") applied to the exit. A WebhookChannel POSTs one
signed JSON shape to a URL you configure; anything that can receive an HTTP
POST — a phone-app bridge, an ntfy relay you host, a desktop applet — becomes a
delivery channel by implementing one receiver. The §13 stance is unchanged: no
team-chat adapters ship here; this is a neutral egress to *your* receiver, the
same personal-delivery posture as the Telegram channel.

The receiver contract (documented in docs/protocol.md §4):

    POST <your url>
    chief-timestamp: <unix seconds>
    chief-signature: v1,<base64 HMAC-SHA256 over "{event_id}.{timestamp}." + body>
    {"event_id", "topic", "summary", "plan", "level", "sent_at"}

The signature scheme is byte-for-byte the svix style already used by the
Composio *inbound* connector, so one verify function covers both directions.
Signing happens only when a secret is configured — but configure one: an
unsigned receiver can't tell Chief from anyone who found its URL.

Transient delivery failures are retried (the actor task is already off the hot
path), then raised — deliver() falls back to the next channel in the chain
(degraded loudness beats a silent loss), and only if every channel fails does
the loss surface in the log. Permanent 4xx responses fail immediately. There
is still no outbound queue; that honest limit is documented.
