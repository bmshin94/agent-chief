"""The generic inbound *push* pipe (SPEC §4.1, generalized).

Chief already accepts events over HTTP (`POST /v1/events`), MCP (`propose`),
and the built-in pollers. This module makes "push attention from anywhere" a
first-class, one-line surface on top of that same `brain.process` entry:

- `push_payload(...)` is the minimal, forgiving envelope — `source` + `summary`
  are enough; topic is inferred, ids/dedup are filled by `normalize`. Both the
  `chief push` CLI and the Telegram inbound relay produce this shape, so there
  is exactly one contract to learn.
- `push_to_daemon(...)` is the client half of `chief push`: it reaches the
  running daemon's webhook with the local bearer token and returns the Decision.
- `describe_decision(...)` renders a Decision as a single human line, reused by
  the CLI output and the Telegram reply so both speak the same language.

Nothing here trusts the caller: `summary` is clamped to the schema's 200-char
limit and control characters never appear in a reply (that is handled at the
delivery edge). The pipe is content-blind — it hands the payload to the same
three-stage funnel every other source goes through.
